# TaskManager

## Overview
This project is a task manager. The main script file is accompanied by two text files, tasks.txt and user.txt. The user is able to log in either as an admin or as another user. Ordinary users can add tasks to the task file, view all tasks, view only their own tasks, and make some limited edits to tasks. The main menu displays additional options for admin users, including the ability to register a user, to generate reports based on information in the tasks and users files, (showing percentages of completed tasks, overdue tasks etc by user and other information), and to view the reports.
